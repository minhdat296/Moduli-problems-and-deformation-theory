            \begin{definition}[Slice $2$-categories] \label{def: slice_2_categories}
                Let $\calK$ be a $2$-category and let $x \in \Ob(\calK)$ be an object therein. Then, we define the \textbf{slice} $2$-category $\calK_{/x}$ to be the $2$-category wherein:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item the objects are $1$-morphisms $(f: y \to x) \in 1\-\Mor(\calK)$,
                        \item the $1$-morphisms $\phi: (y', f') \to (y, f)$ are $1$-commutative triangles of $1$-morphisms $(f': y' \to x), (f: y \to x) \in 1\-\Mor(\calK)$ in $\calK$ of the following form:
                            $$
                                \begin{tikzcd}
                                	{y'} && y \\
                                	& x
                                	\arrow["\phi", from=1-1, to=1-3]
                                	\arrow["{f'}"', from=1-1, to=2-2]
                                	\arrow["f", from=1-3, to=2-2]
                                \end{tikzcd}
                            $$
                        \item and the $2$-morphisms between $1$-morphisms $\phi, \psi: (y', f') \to (y, f)$ are $2$-morphisms $(\eta: \psi \Rightarrow \phi) \in 2\-\Mor(\calK)$ such that the following diagram is $2$-commutative:
                            $$
                                \begin{tikzcd}

                                	& x
                                	\arrow[""{name=0, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "\phi"', bend right, from=1-1, to=1-3]
                                	\arrow["{f'}"', from=1-1, to=2-2]
                                	\arrow["f", from=1-3, to=2-2]
                                	\arrow[""{name=1, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "\psi", bend left, from=1-1, to=1-3]

            \end{definition}
            \begin{example}[Over-categories] \label{example: over_categories}
                Let $\C$ be a category and let $1\-\Cat_2$ be the $2$-category with $1$-categories, functors, and natural transformations as objects, $1$-morphisms, and $2$-morphisms respectively. Then, there is a natural slice $2$-category $(1\-\Cat_2)_{/\C}$ wherein the objects are functors $p: \S \to \C$, $1$-morphisms are the evident $1$-commutative triangles of functors, and $2$-morphisms between $1$-morphisms $F, G: (\S', p') \to (\S, p)$ are natural transformations $\eta \in \Nat(F, G)$ such that $p(\eta_y) = \id_{p'(y)}$ for all $y \in \Ob(\S')$, i.e. such that the following square is strictly $2$-commutative:
                    $$
                        \begin{tikzcd}
                        	{p'(y)} & {p(F(y))} \\
                        	{p'(y)} & {p(G(y))}
                        	\arrow["{p(\eta_y)}", from=1-2, to=2-2]
                        	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
                        	\arrow["{\id_{p'(y)}}"', from=1-1, to=2-1]
                        	\arrow[from=2-1, to=2-2]
                        	\arrow[shorten <=8pt, shorten >=8pt, Rightarrow, from=2-1, to=1-2]
                        \end{tikzcd}
                    $$
                In this sense, $(1\-\Cat_2)_{/\C}$ is not just a $2$-category, but a strict one.

            \begin{definition}[Prefibrations] \label{def: prefibrations}
                Consider a $1$-functor $p: \S \to \C$ between $1$-categories $\S$ and $\C$ is a \textbf{pre-fibration} if and only if it is surjective on the level of both objects and ($1$-)morphisms. 
            \end{definition}
            \begin{remark}[Fibres of prefibrations] \label{remark: fibres_of_prefibrations}
                Consider a prefibration $p: \S \to \C$, viewed as a $1$-morphism of $1\-\Cat_2$, and recall that $1\-\Cat_2$ admits $1$-terminal objects, namely categories that are equivalent to the singleton category $\pt$, as well as $1$-pullbacks. By viewing objects $U \in \Ob(\C)$ as functors $U: \pt \to \C$, one can define \textbf{fibres} of the prefibration $p: \S \to \C$ as $1$-pullbacks of the following kind:
                    $$
                        \begin{tikzcd}
                        	{\S_U} & \S \\
                        	\pt & \C
                        	\arrow["p", from=1-2, to=2-2]
                        	\arrow["U", from=2-1, to=2-2]
                        	\arrow["{p_U}"', from=1-1, to=2-1]
                        	\arrow[from=1-1, to=1-2]
                        	\arrow["\lrcorner"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=2-2]
                        \end{tikzcd}
                    $$
                It is then easy to see that $\S_U$ is the category wherein the objects are objects $x \in \S$ such that $p(x) = U$ and the morphisms are morphisms $(\phi: y \to x) \in \Mor(\S)$ such that $p(\phi) = \id_U$, and as such one ought to view $p_U: \S_U \to \pt$ as the unique functor from $\S_U$ to the singleton category whose only object is $U$ and whose only morphism is $\id_U$. Therefore, one can instead define prefibrations as functors $p: \S \to \C$ with non-empty fibres in the sense above and identify them by the families of $1$-pullbacks $\{\S \x_{p, \C, U} \pt\}_{U \in \Ob(\C)}$.
            \end{remark}
            \begin{remark}[The strict $2$-category of pre-fibrations]
                By definition, prefibrations $p: \S \to \C$ are objects of the strict $2$-category $(1\-\Cat_2)_{/\C}$, and so we might be tempted to declare that there is a $2$-full subcategory $\Pre\Fib(\C) \overset{2}{\subset} (1\-\Cat_2)_{/\C}$ spanned by prefibrations over $\C$, and indeed there is. To check that this is the case, one can verify that given any $1$-morphism $(F: (\S', p') \to (\S, p)) \in 1\-\Mor((1\-\Cat_2)_{/\C})$ and any object $U \in \C$, there exists a functor $F_U: \S'_U \to \S_U$ making the following diagram $1$-commutative in $1\-\Cat_2$:
                    $$
                        \begin{tikzcd}
                        	{\S'_U} &&&& {\S_U} \\
                        	{\S'} &&&& \S \\
                        	&& \pt \\
                        	&& \C
                        	\arrow["{p'}"', from=2-1, to=4-3]
                        	\arrow["U", from=3-3, to=4-3]
                        	\arrow["{p'_U}"', from=1-1, to=3-3]
                        	\arrow["\lrcorner"{anchor=center, pos=0.125}, draw=none, from=1-1, to=4-3]
                        	\arrow[from=1-1, to=2-1]
                        	\arrow["{p_U}", from=1-5, to=3-3]
                        	\arrow[from=1-5, to=2-5]
                        	\arrow["p", from=2-5, to=4-3]
                        	\arrow["F", from=2-1, to=2-5]
                        	\arrow["{F_U}", from=1-1, to=1-5, dashed]
                        	\arrow["\lrcorner"{anchor=center, pos=0.125, rotate=-90}, draw=none, from=1-5, to=4-3]
                        \end{tikzcd}
                    $$
                and similarly for $2$-morphisms in $\Pre\Fib(\C)$. We leave this as an exercise for the reader.
